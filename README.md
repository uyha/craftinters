# Crafting Interpreters in Zig

## Differences from the original

The [Metaprogramming the trees](https://craftinginterpreters.com/representing-code.html#metaprogramming-the-trees)
section is omitted since it only exists due to Java's verboseness in defining classes.
Whereas Zig's syntax for defining the actual class is shorter than doing metaprogramming
stuff.
